Description: Watershed is an unsupervised probabilistic framework that
    integrates genomic annotations and RNA-seq outlier calls to identify
    the probability a rare variant has a functional effect on a particular
    RNA-seq outlier phenotype (examples of outlier phenotypes can be, but
    are not limited to total expression, splicing, or ASE). Watershed
    extends our previous model RIVER (which can also be run via this
    package) by incoorperating information from multiple outlier
    phenoytpes into one model, where predictions for functional effects in
    one outlier phenotype are informed by observed outlier calls in
    another phenotype.
